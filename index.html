    <p class="me">Hi, I am Rajbir Singh!</p>
    <p class="q">"Everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear." â€” George Addair</p>
    <h2 class="intro" id="a1"><u>Know Me Better</u></h2>
    <p class="intro1">Hi, I'm <u><b>Rajbir Singh</b></u> (also known as Rajveer Rawat) â€“ 
        a student and lifelong learner with a deep passion for technology, design, and the art of digital self-expression.
        Born in the serene hills of <i><b>Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand</b></i>, I moved to the city when I was three, carrying with me the curiosity of mountain air 
        and the ambition of urban dreams. This blend of natural roots and city life has shaped my unique perspective on creativity and innovation.
        I thrive on exploring whatever sparks my curiosity and believe deeply in the power of continuous growth. Lately, 
        I've been captivated by <i><b>photography</b></i> â€“ discovering how light, composition, and timing can tell stories that words sometimes can't capture.
        My journey is one driven by curiosity, vision, and heart â€“ always seeking to learn, create, and connect through the digital canvas of our modern world. ðŸŒ±ðŸ“¸ðŸŒ±
    </p>
    <h1 class="school"><u>School Diaries</u></h1>  
    <p class="s1">When I was in school, I used to hate everything about it â€“ from the endless studies to those mind-numbingly boring lectures. 
        Every morning felt like a battle, and I would count down the hours until I could escape those classroom walls. 
        But now, looking back with clearer eyes, I realize how beautifully naive I was. 
        Those days I complained about were actually weaving together some of the most precious memories of my life.
        I'll never again make friends like those â€“ the ones who shared their lunch without being asked, who covered for me during tests, who laughed until our stomachs hurt.
         I'll never again feel that electric excitement for games period, or fight over lunch with that same innocent passion.
          School wasn't just about learning subjects â€“ it was about learning how to be human. 
        Those simple joys are locked in time now, and never gonna get those days back â€“ which is exactly what makes them so precious. ðŸ“šðŸ’™
    </p>

    <h2 class="skills" id="b1"><u>Technical Proficiencies</u></h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><button class="java">Java (Intermediate)</button><p>I began my Java journey at the end of my second semester and have since developed a intermediate-level proficiency in the language. 
        However, the journey never stops â€“ there's always something new to discover, whether it's advanced design patterns, enterprise frameworks, 
        or emerging Java features. This continuous learning mindset keeps me excited about building better solutions and expanding my technical horizons. ðŸš€
        </p></li>
        <li><button class="front">Front-end (Basic)</button><p>I've recently embarked on my front-end development journey and am currently building a strong foundation in the core technologies -
             HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I'm still in the early stages of learning, I'm passionate about 
             creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces and understanding how design meets functionality.
            My plan is to accelerate my learning through hands-on experience - building real-world projects that challenge me to apply new concepts and deploy them 
            live. I believe in learning by doing, so each project will serve as both a learning opportunity and a showcase of my growing skills. 
            The goal is to evolve from basic implementations to more complex, interactive web applications that demonstrate both technical proficiency and
             creative problem-solving. ðŸš€</p></li>
        <li><button class="management">Management Skills</button><p>My management abilities stem from a natural inclination to organize, lead, and collaborate effectively with diverse teams. 
            I excel at strategic planning and breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks while maintaining clear timelines and deliverables.
             Communication forms the cornerstone of my management approach â€“ I believe in transparent dialogue and ensuring every team member feels heard and valued.</p></li>
